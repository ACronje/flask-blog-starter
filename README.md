# Flask blog starter project

Blog application built with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/).

**next, in your project root, install the Python dependencies by executing:**

```
make dev_install
```

**then run the application by executing:***

```
make run
```

## Linting

To lint your Python code using *flake8* run:

```
make lint
```

## Testing

Run the automated tests by executing:

```
make test
```
